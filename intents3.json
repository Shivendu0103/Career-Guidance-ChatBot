Also, It helps an aspirant with an array to work in industries. Math is in various fields. Students can go for a MSc in mathematics. It is a two-year program. It is for the candidates who are interested in exploring the course. Many universities offer this course such as IIT\u2019s, NIT\u2019s, IISER, etc. Also, One needs to clear certain entrance exams such as TIFR GS, NEST, JEST, etc. Hence, It allows you to do research work in the subject. Also, The average salary is INR 6 to 9 lakhs per annum. It is considered to be a good deal of business. One of the career options is teaching. Also, It is one of the most selfless jobs in India. It is a great deal of honor. Mathematics is a demanding job. However, The kit is a blend of teaching and care. People find a suitable job in government institutions and other sectors. There are some added incentives and benefits attached to it. Most of these jobs need reasoning. These aspirants seem to have an upper hand over such jobs. Some competitive exams come with these jobs which one has to crack. Therefore a graduate can easily hit the bull\u2019s eye. Jobs offered in various public sectors and institutes like ISRO and DRDO.Learning in LPU will make you a truly global citizen.

                "Too many variables here. Your point of interest,what do u wanna be later in life,where u wanna study. So giving a generic answer. Studying chemistry honours is a good thing if u want to continue in that field later. I have a friend who topped her university in chemistry honours from CU but then is doing an MBA. But doing BSC in Maths leaves scope for more options after graduation. But let me remind you that BSc Maths isnt really similar to 12th standard maths and there will be surprises and WILL be very difficult . But then you can pursue several fields in Maths later and also can do MCA. But primarily,answer the following questions for a better reply.1. Your subject of interest.(irrespective of the marks u got)2. Do you want to go into corporate or research or academics later in life?3.Which state are you from?4. Have you scored enough to get into the top institutions? (Dont have to reveal your marks or details)",
                "Disclaimer: As clear from my bio, I only took one compulsory semester of Physics at CMI (Classical Mechanics I, which I loved) since I am a Math+CS student.Very few of my classmates who have opted for Physics came here to study Physics; whereas, the Math+CS section has both Math and CS enthusiasts in significant proportion. Physics is a popular choice for the second subject for Maths students who are uncomfortable with CS due to prior inexperience/are under the impression that it brings better grades. Whether any of this is logical or true I do not know! Of course, there are people who have interest and experience in both Physics and CS and choose Physics for some reason.However, the (mostly) same people who taught Physics before are still teaching Physics in the Math/Physics course. Kids have gained an interest in Physics after taking it, and switched over from Math (as have many Math+CS kids switched from Math to CS). They, along with the few who came here to primarily study Physics, have done no less well in life than the oldies who studied the pure Physics degree. My batch-mates from the Physics section are not hating it, if not liking it. Everyone is definitely fond of Classical Mechanics II by Prof. Govind Krishnaswami, as the Anon below (who I am currently attempting to identify :P) says. (His/her opinion on Math, btw, will be unpopular among our pure Math nerds).A former student of my acquaintance did the pure Physics degree and is now in Germany. His profs are now teaching my Math+Physics friends. If you do not mind studying Math as deeply as you study Physics, you are definitely in good hands here. Be warned though, that the Math courses are pretty demanding and cannot be ignored if you want your degree!",

                "Short answer: a PhD. Hehe.Not all students here come primarily for Math. The degree is compulsorily dual, with compulsory courses in both Math/CS or Math/Physics upto the second year. There exist people who are focussed on the other part (CS/Physics) from the beginning. Since you ask about sticking to Math, I omit them from this answer hereafter.A good number of kids have no idea what real Mathematics is like, since high school maths is at least 50% applicative and has little to no abstraction. Some develop a taste for it, in their previously favourite field or another field; others do an MSc in Applied Mathematics instead of pure Mathematics. Often they shift to the job sector (or not). Others shift to CS/Physics, and have sterling careers in it. The Math sticklers dominate, but among them the pure:applied ratio varies.Even some Math Olympiad kids are tripped up by abstraction beyond a certain point ('tricks' no longer work, as a professor quipped once), or simply get interested in CS/Physics more. They too have great careers if they work for it.CMI students mostly do a PhD eventually, irrespective of subject. Some go through an MSc while others skip it, each path having pros and cons, which is a whole different Quora question (which exists, you may want to read those answers). For CMI undergrads it is best to not take too hasty a decision about the future career path, and to take in all compulsory courses with an open mind before picking their favourite electives.Oh, and, if you are a concerned parent or something, with latent questions about the earning prospects, don't worry. They'll live. Comfortably, or maybe even better. Post-MSc, you can expect financial independence via a job or a doctoral programme. Post-PhD, they have good prospects in academia, given they work, of course. The CMI website has some placement history. You could look at it!",

Starting from the first year there are around 60 students in the stats course which would drop to 15-20 students in third year. Maintaining a good GPA is the key to placements and as well as getting stats in third year.

Being a statistics student myself, I found that with this subject you are left with very few things to do. Now you can go for- Masters in statistics, PHd, or if your ultimate goal is a good government job, you have SSC CGL, UPSC ISS. If you complete your masters from an ordinary college you are really no more than an arts student who prepares for govt job like hell. You need to crack Bhu entrance,ISI, or JAM, these universities give you ample opportunities ahead.
